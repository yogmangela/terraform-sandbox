        Execute a command in a pod.

        This method will return when and only when the supplied command exits, even if
        the command has launched background processes (e.g. with `bash -c "foo &"`).
        Any background processes will continue to run and will not be subject to the
        optional timeout.

        When executing a command over connect_get_namespaced_pod_exec, the websocket
        connection is not "naturally" closed until both:
        - The command has exited.
        - The stdout and stderr streams have been closed (including by any commands
          which have inherited them).
        This is behaviour of the CRI-O implementation which is running on the Kubernetes
        nodes.

        To support the required functionality, the supplied command is executed in a
        shell (/bin/sh).

        To allow this method to return when the supplied command has completed, even if
        backgrounded processes which inherit stdout or stderr are still running, a
        sentinel value is written to stdout after the supplied command has completed.
        When this sentinel value is detected, we close the websocket connection. This
        sentinel value also includes the exit code of the supplied command, as we won't
        have access to /bin/sh's return code if we manually close the websocket.

        Args:
          cmd (list[str]): The command and arguments to execute.
          stdin (str | bytes | None): The optional standard input to pipe into cmd.
            The stdin file descriptor will be closed after the input has been written.
          cwd (str | None): The working directory to change to before executing cmd.
            Relative directories will be resolved relative to the pod's default working
            directory. If None, the default working directory is used. If the provided
            directory does not exist, an unsuccessful ExecResult will be returned and
            cmd will not be run.
          env (dict[str, str]): The environment variables to set before running cmd.
          user (str | None): The user to run the command as. If None, the default user
            for the pod will be used. The container must be running as root to run as a
            different user and the runuser command must be available in the container.
          timeout (int | None): The optional timeout for cmd to complete in. Defaults to
            no timeout. If provided, SIGTERM will be sent to cmd once the timeout has
            elapsed. This is enforced by the `timeout` command on the pod. This will not
            terminate background processes started by cmd.
